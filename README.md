## Installation and usage

Start the server

```console
$ sshportal server
2017/11/13 10:58:35 Admin user created, use the user 'invite:BpLnfgDsc2WD8F2q' to associate a public key with this account
2017/11/13 10:58:35 SSH Server accepting connections on :2222
```

Link your SSH key with the admin account

```console
$ ssh localhost -p 2222 -l invite:BpLnfgDsc2WD8F2q
Welcome admin!

Your key is now associated with the user "admin@sshportal".
Shared connection to localhost closed.
$
```

If the association fails and you are prompted for a password, verify that the host you're connecting from has a SSH key set up or generate one with ```ssh-keygen -t rsa```

Drop an interactive administrator shell

```console
ssh localhost -p 2222 -l admin


    __________ _____           __       __
   / __/ __/ // / _ \___  ____/ /____ _/ /
  _\ \_\ \/ _  / ___/ _ \/ __/ __/ _ '/ /
 /___/___/_//_/_/   \___/_/  \__/\_,_/_/


config>
```

Create your first host

```console
config> host create bart@foo.example.org
1
config>
```

List hosts

```console
config> host ls
  ID | NAME |           URL           |   KEY   | PASS | GROUPS  | COMMENT
+----+------+-------------------------+---------+------+---------+---------+
   1 | foo  | bart@foo.example.org:22 | default |      | default |
Total: 1 hosts.
config>
```

Add the key to the server

```console
$ ssh bart@foo.example.org "$(ssh localhost -p 2222 -l admin key setup default)"
$
```

Profit

```console
ssh localhost -p 2222 -l foo
bart@foo>
```

Invite friends

*This command doesn't create a user on the remote server, it only creates an account in the sshportal database.*

```console
config> user invite bob@example.com
User 2 created.
To associate this account with a key, use the following SSH user: 'invite:NfHK5a84jjJkwzDk'.
config>
```

## Use cases

Used by educators to provide temporary access to students. [Feedback from a teacher](https://github.com/moul/sshportal/issues/64). The author is using it in one of his projects, *pathwar*, to dynamically configure hosts and users, so that he can give temporary accesses for educational purposes.

*vptech*, the vente-privee.com technical team (a group of over 6000 people) is using it internally to manage access to servers/routers, saving hours on configuration management and not having to share the configuration information.

There are companies who use a jump host to monitor connections at a single point.

A hosting company is using SSHportal for its “logging” feature, among others. As every session is logged and introspectable, they have a detailed history of who performed which action. This company made its own contribution to the project, allowing the support of [more than 65.000 sessions in the database](https://github.com/moul/sshportal/pull/76).

The project has also received [multiple contributions from a security researcher](https://github.com/moul/sshportal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Asabban+sort%3Aupdated-desc) that made a thesis on quantum cryptography. This person uses SSHportal in their security-hardened hosting company.

If you need to invite multiple people to an event (hackathon, course, etc), the day before the event you can create multiple accounts at once, print the invite, and distribute the paper.

## Features and limitations

* Single autonomous binary (~10-20Mb) with no runtime dependencies (embeds ssh server and client)
* Portable / Cross-platform (regularly tested on linux and OSX/darwin)
* Store data in [Sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/) or [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) (probably easy to add postgres, mssql thanks to gorm)

* Connect to remote host using key or password
* Admin commands can be run directly or in an interactive shell
* Host management
* User management (invite, group, stats)
* Host Key management (create, remove, update, import)
* Automatic remote host key learning
* User Key management (multiple keys per user)
* ACL management (acl+user-groups+host-groups)
* User roles (admin, trusted, standard, ...)
* User invitations (no more "give me your public ssh key please")
* Easy server installation (generate shell command to setup `authorized_keys`)
* Sensitive data encryption
* Session management (see active connections, history, stats, stop)
* Audit log (logging every user action)
* Record TTY Session (with [ttyrec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ttyrec) format, use `ttyplay` for replay)
* Tunnels logging
* Host Keys verifications shared across users
* Healthcheck user (replying OK to any user)

  * [`sftp`](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/sftp/) support
  * [`ssh-agent`](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/agent) support
  * [`X11 forwarding`](http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/XDMCP-HOWTO/ssh.html) support
  * Git support (can be used to easily use multiple user keys on GitHub, or access your own firewalled gitlab server)
  * Do not require any SSH client modification or custom `.ssh/config`, works with every tested SSH programming libraries and every tested SSH clients
* SSH to non-SSH proxy
  * [Telnet](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/telnet) support

**(Known) limitations**

* Does not work (yet?) with [`mosh`](https://mosh.org/)
* It is not possible for a user to access a host with the same name as the user. This is easily circumvented by changing the user name, especially since the most common use cases does not expose it.
* It is not possible to access a host named `healthcheck` as this is a built-in command.

## Docker

Docker is the recommended way to run sshportal.

An [automated build is setup on the Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/moul/sshportal/tags/).

```console
# Start a server in background
#   mount `pwd` to persist the sqlite database file
docker run -p 2222:2222 -d --name=sshportal -v "$(pwd):$(pwd)" -w "$(pwd)" moul/sshportal:v1.10.0

# check logs (mandatory on first run to get the administrator invite token)
docker logs -f sshportal
```

The easier way to upgrade sshportal is to do the following:

```sh
# we consider you were using an old version and you want to use the new version v1.10.0

# stop and rename the last working container + backup the database
docker stop sshportal
docker rename sshportal sshportal_old
cp sshportal.db sshportal.db.bkp

# run the new version
docker run -p 2222:2222 -d --name=sshportal -v "$(pwd):$(pwd)" -w "$(pwd)" moul/sshportal:v1.10.0
# check the logs for migration or cross-version incompatibility errors
docker logs -f sshportal
```

Now you can test ssh-ing to sshportal to check if everything looks OK.

In case of problem, you can rollback to the latest working version with the latest working backup, using:

```sh
docker stop sshportal
docker rm sshportal
cp sshportal.db.bkp sshportal.db
docker rename sshportal_old sshportal
docker start sshportal
docker logs -f sshportal
```

---

## Manual Install

Get the latest version using GO.

```sh
go install moul.io/sshportal@latest
```

---

## Backup / Restore

sshportal embeds built-in backup/restore methods which basically import/export JSON objects:

```sh
# Backup
ssh portal config backup  > sshportal.bkp

# Restore
ssh portal config restore < sshportal.bkp
```

This method is particularly useful as it should be resistant against future DB schema changes (expected during development phase).

I suggest you to be careful during this development phase, and use an additional backup method, for example:

```sh
# sqlite dump
sqlite3 sshportal.db .dump > sshportal.sql.bkp

# or just the immortal cp
cp sshportal.db sshportal.db.bkp
```

---

## built-in shell

`sshportal` embeds a configuration CLI.

By default, the configuration user is `admin`, (can be changed using `--config-user=<value>` when starting the server. The shell is also accessible through `ssh [username]@portal.example.org`.

Each command can be run directly by using this syntax: `ssh admin@portal.example.org <command> [args]`:

```
ssh admin@portal.example.org host inspect toto
```

You can enter in interactive mode using this syntax: `ssh admin@portal.example.org`

---

## Demo data

The following servers are freely available, without external registration,
it makes it easier to quickly test `sshportal` without configuring your own servers to accept sshportal connections.

```
ssh portal host create new@sdf.org
ssh sdf@portal

ssh portal host create test@whoami.filippo.io
ssh whoami@portal

ssh portal host create test@chat.shazow.net
ssh chat@portal
```

## Healthcheck

By default, `sshportal` will return `OK` to anyone sshing using the `healthcheck` user without checking for authentication.

```console
$ ssh healthcheck@sshportal
OK
$
```

the `healtcheck` user can be changed using the `healthcheck-user` option.

---

Alternatively, you can run the built-in healthcheck helper (requiring no ssh client nor ssh key):

Usage: `sshportal healthcheck [--addr=host:port] [--wait] [--quiet]

```console
$ sshportal healthcheck --addr=localhost:2222; echo $?
$ 0
```

---

Wait for sshportal to be healthy, then connect

```console
$ sshportal healthcheck --wait && ssh sshportal -l admin
config>
```

---

## portal alias (.ssh/config)

Edit your `~/.ssh/config` file (create it first if needed)

```ini
Host portal
  User      admin
  Port      2222       # portal port
  HostName  127.0.0.1  # portal hostname
```

```bash
# you can now run a shell using this:
ssh portal
# instead of this:
ssh localhost -p 2222 -l admin

# or connect to hosts using this:
ssh hostname@portal
# instead of this:
ssh localhost -p 2222 -l hostname
```

---

## Scaling

`sshportal` is stateless but relies on a database to store configuration and logs.

By default, `sshportal` uses a local [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database which isn't scalable by design.

You can run multiple instances of `sshportal` sharing the same [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) database, using `sshportal --db-conn=user:pass@host/dbname?parseTime=true --db-driver=mysql`.
